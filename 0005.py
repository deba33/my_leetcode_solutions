class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        """ 
        This code finds the longest palindrome substring in a given string 's'. It first checks if the length of the string is less than 2, in which case it returns the string itself as it is already a palindrome. It then initializes the maximum length of the palindrome substring to 1 and the starting index of the substring to 0.

        The code then iterates through the string and checks if there is a palindrome substring centered at the current index. It does this by checking if the substring to the left and right of the current index is the same when reversed. If there is a palindrome substring, it updates the maximum length and starting index accordingly.

        The code continues to iterate through the string, checking for palindromes until it reaches the end. Finally, it returns the longest palindrome substring found in the string.
